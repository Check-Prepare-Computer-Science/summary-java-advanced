## Installation

### Compile LaTeX

The custom packages must exist on the TeX path so that the packages can be used.

This can be found with the command:

```sh
kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME
```

> Under Linux this is usually `~/texmf/tex/latex`

Note that a TeX distribution and the package `tuda-ci` must be available.
